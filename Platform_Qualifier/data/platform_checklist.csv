Scoring Scale (per Criterion),,,Weight (W),,,,,
Score,Meaning,,Weight Range,Interpretation,,Explanation,,
0,Not applicable or not present in requirements,,25 – 30,Core Platform Trait (High),,"These criteria are essential to platform qualification. If these are missing, the solution likely cannot be considered a platform. Examples: Scope & Reusability, Ecosystem Enablement, Multi-Use-Case Support.",,
1,Minimal alignment — some potential but mostly specific to a single use/application,,15 – 24,Enabling Trait (Medium) ,,"These traits enhance platform quality but are not standalone proof of a platform. They often indicate maturity, scale, or enterprise readiness. Examples: Developer Experience, Security & Compliance, Cross-Domain Applicability.",,
2,Partial alignment — reusable or extensible components but not fully ecosystem-ready,,10 – 14,Support Trait (Low),,"Important for operability, maintainability, and ease of adoption, but not central to defining a platform. These are often technical enablers or maintenance features.Examples: Upgradeability & Versioning, Migration Readiness.",,
3,"Strong alignment — clear platform traits, multi-use, reusable, and scalable architecture",,,,,,,
